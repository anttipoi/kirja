<h2>More utilities</h2>

<p>Finally, we have some utilities which hopefully explain themselves in code.</p>

<p>There's little point in replacing code comments or documentation strings with 
literate programming.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt;main&gt;&gt;
(ns kirja.util
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io])
  (:import [java.io File]))

(defn ensure-parent-directories-exist
  "mkdir -p for the parent of file."
  [^File file]
  (.. file getParentFile mkdirs))


(defmacro with-resource-stream
  "evaluates body with resource-symbol bound to an InputStream for resource."
  [[resource-symbol resource-name] &amp; body]
  `(with-open [~resource-symbol (-&gt; (Thread/currentThread)
                                    (.getContextClassLoader)
                                    (.getResourceAsStream ~resource-name))]
     ~@body))

(defn copy-resource
  "copies resource resource-name to output-file."
  [^String resource-name ^File output-file]
  (ensure-parent-directories-exist output-file)
  (with-resource-stream [st resource-name]
    (with-open [out-stream (io/output-stream output-file)]
      (io/copy st out-stream))))

(defn copy-file
  "copies file in to out, creating parent directories if needed."
  [^File in ^File out]
  (ensure-parent-directories-exist out)
  (io/copy in out))

&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
